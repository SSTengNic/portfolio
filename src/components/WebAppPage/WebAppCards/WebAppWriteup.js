            This web application is a showcase of my FullStack skills, featuring
            a <b>React.js frontend🌐,</b> an <b>Express backend⚙️,</b> and{" "}
            <b>Node.js🟢</b> powering the backend logic. Two similar versions
            are built to handle two distinct databases: one for <b>MongoDB🗄️</b>{" "}
            and another for <b>MySQL🛢️</b>, each implemented with{" "}
            <b>CRUD functionality.</b>
        </>

            Building both databases allowed me to grasp the nuances{" "}
            <b>between relational and document-based database systems.</b>{" "}
            Additionally, I've taken care to ensure consistency and efficiency
            across both the frontend and backend codebases. Despite minor
            differences, the frontend seamlessly integrates with the backend,
            delivering a<b>cohesive user experience🎉.</b>

            This project has been instrumental in enhancing my understanding of
            FullStack development, equipping me with valuable insights into{" "}

            Some main improvements of this app would be to{" "}
            <b>improve the UI of the frontend.</b> Currently, I did not
            implement any designs to make the app look better🎨, but rather I
            focused on wanting to learn how full stack application works.

            Moreover, I could continue to implement more features, such as a{" "}
            <b>comment section💬,</b> or a <b>personal profile page</b> where
            users can see all of their own posts only📄, or also tap into other
            people's profiles to see their blogs. Doing so, would be akin to
            designing something similar to a social media app📱.
