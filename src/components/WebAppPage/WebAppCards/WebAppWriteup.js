    modalBodyDescription1: `This web application is a showcase
                                            of my FullStack skills, featuring a
                                            React.js frontend, an Express
                                            backend, and Node.js powering the
                                            backend logic. Two similar versions
                                            are built to handle two distinct
                                            databases: one for MongoDB and
                                            another for MySQL, each implemented
                                            with CRUD functionality.`,
    modalBodyDescription2: `Building both databases allowed me
                                            to grasp the nuances between
                                            relational and document-based
                                            database systems. Additionally, I've
                                            taken care to ensure consistency and
                                            efficiency across both the frontend
                                            and backend codebases. Despite minor
                                            differences, the frontend seamlessly
                                            integrates with the backend,
                                            delivering a cohesive user
                                            experience.`,
    modalBodyDescription3: `This project has been instrumental
                                            in enhancing my understanding of
                                            FullStack development, equipping me
                                            with valuable insights into building
                                            robust and scalable web
                                            applications.`,
    modalBodyDescription4: `Some main improvements of this app
                                            would be to improve the UI of the
                                            frontend. Currently, I did not
                                            implement any designs to make the
                                            app look better, but rather I
                                            focused on wanting to learn how full
                                            stack application works.`,
    modalBodyDescription5: `Moreover, I could continue to
                                            implement more features, such as a
                                            comment section, or a personal
                                            profile page where users can see all
                                            of their own posts only, or also tap
                                            into other people's profiles to see
                                            their blogs. Doing so, would be akin
                                            to designing something similar to a
                                            social media app.`,
