            <b>Digital Automation</b> stands poised to revolutionize the modern
            workplace. Currently, many companies rely on manual data entry

            <b>excessive costs.</b> UiPath, however, presents a transformative
            solution by introducing 'robots'ü§ñ called Robotic Process

            During my internship at SimplifyNext, I developed RPAs that helped
            clients <b>reclaim valuable time‚è≥</b> previously lost to repetitive

            <b>debugging intricate RPA processesüëæ</b> at a bank. I also

            <b>building part of the RPA logic</b> that interfaced with their
            internal banking software. Additionally, I optimized a complex
            process by implementing a condition logic that{" "}

            As an IT Solutions Developer Intern, I{" "}

            DynamoDB tables to align with the department's data requirements,

            optimized cost savings by evaluating pricing models such as
            <b>On-Demand and Provisioned Capacity Modes,</b> and fine-tuning{" "}
            <b>Write and Read Capacity Units</b> based on anticipated usage. I
