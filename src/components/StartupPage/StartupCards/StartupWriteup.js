    modalBodyDescription1: `Recognizing an opportunity to enhance consumer
                        engagement with promotions, PinchPromo introduced
                        a gamified approach to claiming promotions. This
                        innovative advertising company also offers a
                        feature for users to conveniently catalog their
                        acquired offers, enhancing the memorability of
                        promotions and instilling a sense of
                        accomplishment.`,

    modalBodyDescription2: `My primary role involved securing partnerships
                        with various businesses, persuading them to share
                        their promotions on our platform. I successfully
                        onboarded approximately a dozen diverse companies.`,
    modalBodyDescription3: ` Additionally, I proficiently utilized Cypress and
                        took charge of conducting User System Testing for
                        both the user interface and the client dashboard.
                        The rigorous System Testing process not only
                        unearthed and rectified bugs but also ensured the
                        stability of the PinchPromo web application after
                        every implementation of new features and code

    modalBodyDescription5: `After much reflection and consideration, we made
                        the difficult decision to cease our operations at
                        PinchPromo. The demanding commitment required for
                        running a startup, along with the need to balance
                        our school lives, led us to this choice. However,
                        as part of this transition, we successfully sold
                        our user base and the code base to another
                        company. Overall, we believe we had a positive
                        impact on the businesses we worked with, and I am
                        eager to apply the lessons learned to my future
                        projects.`,
